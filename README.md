# Taqueria El Apache

Created a taco order logger for a mock taqueria that utilizes MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. It follows the MVC design pattern; uses Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.

## Details of Taco Logger

* Taqueria El Apache is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of tacos they'd like to eat.
* Whenever a user submits a taco's name, the app displays the taco order on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
* Each taco in the waiting area also has a `Devour!` button. When the user clicks it, the taco will move to the right side of the page.
* The app will store every taco in a database, whether devoured or not.
